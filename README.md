# requirements
Repository used for Task 3 of the I-ADOPT workplan to define terminology requirements for given use cases 

New issue tickets will be created for each individual requirement.

The goal is to develop a comprehensive set of terminology requirements based on the user stories submitted and on the formal use cases. As a first step we will focus on a single user story and use it to develop a method and template for deriving requirements from the other submitted user stories. We chose to start with [user story #20](https://github.com/i-adopt/users_stories/issues/20).

User stories requirements will not all be terminology related. Only the ones which are will be in scope for I-ADOPT. 

The first step is to identify the actions (events) that are needed in order to achieve the goal of the user story. The requirements will then consist of all the resources and other conditions necessary to successfully perform the actions described in the user story. We will make a distinction between necessary requirements (without them the action cannot take place) and optional requirements, that provide additional benefits (make the user story easier to fulfill, more complete, ...). After having extracted all requirements for each of the user story we will regroup and abstract them in order to be able to define use case specific requirements.

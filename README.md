# requirements
Repository used for Task 3 of the I-ADOPT workplan to define terminology requirements for given use cases 

The goal is to distinguish single requirements as issues in this repository which than can be assigned to the user stories

As first step we try to refine a specific user story to be able to dervive requirments. Some of these requirments will be terminology related, others not, so those would be out of scope for I-ADOPT but still necessary to be identified. Then we harmonise our views on the terminology requirements to be able to suggest a template for requirements. We choose user story (issue 20) from our GitHub repository https://github.com/i-adopt/users_stories/issues/20. The refinement would imply that we can distinguish needed actions (events) to achieve the goal of the user story. Requirements are then all resources and other conditions that are necessary to successfully perform the actions described in the user story. The relevant requirements would embrace any kind of information which a conceptual model have to provide in order be used in this user story. We also want to distinguish between necessary requirements, that are essential to this fulfillment (without them it does not work), and optional requirements, that provide additional benefits (make the user story easier, more complete, ...). After having extracted all requirments for each of the user story we will regroup and abstract them in order to be able to define use case specific requirements.
